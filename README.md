# VideoShare

A self-contained media sharing platform — video, audio, and image — packaged as a single Go binary with an embedded Svelte single-page application. Zero runtime dependencies.

## Features

- **Single binary deployment** — CGO_ENABLED=0 static build. One file, nothing else to install.
- **Multi-user system** — Two roles: `admin` (full control) and `uploader` (upload and delete own media only).
- **TOTP authentication** — No passwords. Login via authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.).
- **Session & token auth** — Session cookie for streaming, Bearer token for API access.
- **Video, audio, and image support** — All media types in one unified system.
- **HLS transcoding** — Adaptive quality ladder (360p, 720p, 1080p) via ffmpeg with concurrent workers.
- **Content-addressed storage** — BLAKE3 hashing deduplicates identical files automatically.
- **Magic-byte detection** — File types identified by content, not extension. Wrong extensions corrected on upload.
- **Password-protected sharing** — Per-resource passwords for share links (`/#/v/{id}`).
- **Categories & playlists** — Admin-created categories assignable to uploaders; playlists group resources within categories.
- **HTTP range request streaming** — Efficient delivery for video and audio.
- **Rate limiting** — 60 requests/minute per IP.
- **Readme support** — Markdown descriptions per resource.
- **In-memory view guard** — Accurate view counting without duplication.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+ (for backend build)
- Node.js (for frontend build)
- ffmpeg (for HLS transcoding)

### Build and Run

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd videoshare

# Build the frontend SPA
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Copy the SPA into the backend's embedded assets
cp frontend/dist/index.html backend/web/spa/index.html

# Build the server
cd backend
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o ../videoserver .
cd ..

# Run it
./videoserver
```

### First Boot

On first run, the server creates a SQLite database, bootstraps the admin account, and prints a TOTP URI and QR code directly in the terminal:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════
  Admin Account Created!
  Username: admin
  Scan the QR code below with your
  authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
  Or enter the URI manually in your browser
  TOTP URI: otpauth://totp/VideoShare:admin?...
═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

Scan the QR code with your authenticator app, then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. Enter `admin` as the username and the 6-digit code from your authenticator app.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PORT` | `:8080` | Listen address (e.g., `:8080` or `127.0.0.1:8080`) |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Data directory for database and media storage |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Admin login username |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | `false` | Set to `true` when using HTTPS |
| `FFMPEG_PATH` | `ffmpeg` | Path to ffmpeg binary |
| `TRANSCODE_WORKERS` | `1` | Number of concurrent HLS transcodes |

## URL Scheme

### SPA Routes (hash-based)

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/#/login` | Login page (TOTP auth) |
| `/#/v/{hash}` | Video/audio/image watch page |
| `/#/v/{hash}/watch` | Watch page (after authentication) |
| `/#/admin` | Admin dashboard (manage users, categories, playlists) |
| `/#/admin/users` | User management (admin only) |
| `/#/admin/categories` | Category management (admin only) |
| `/#/admin/playlists` | Playlist management (admin only) |

### Direct Access Routes

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/v/{hash}` | Raw video file (direct access) |
| `/v/{hash}/hls/{path}` | HLS streaming — master.m3u8, segment.ts, etc. |
| `/v/{hash}/download` | Download original file |
| `/a/{hash}` | Audio streaming |
| `/i/{hash}` | Image streaming |

## Authentication Flow

1. **Login**: `POST /api/session` with `{"type": "user", "username": "...", "totp_code": "..."}`
   - Returns an `api_token` (Bearer token) for API calls
   - Sets a session cookie automatically for HLS/streaming access

2. **API calls**: Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on all requests.

3. **Share links**: `POST /api/session` with `{"type": "share", "resource_id": "...", "password": "..."}`
   - Sets a session cookie granting access to HLS streaming for that resource

4. **Token auth**: `POST /api/session` with `{"type": "token", "token": "..."}`
   - Creates a session from an existing Bearer token

5. **HLS streaming**: Requests include the session cookie, validated by the `RequireUserOrVideoAuth` middleware.

## Storage Layout

Media files are stored under `DATA_DIR` organized by type and BLAKE3 hash:

```
DATA_DIR/
├── videoshare.db              # SQLite database
├── video/
│   └── {xx}/
│       └── {yy}/
│           └── {hash}/
│               ├── original   # Original uploaded file
│               ├── thumbnail  # Generated thumbnail
│               └── hls/
│                   ├── 360p/  # 360p HLS segments
│                   ├── 720p/  # 720p HLS segments
│                   ├── 1080p/ # 1080p HLS segments
│                   └── master.m3u8
├── audio/
│   └── {xx}/
│       └── {yy}/
│           └── {hash}/
│               └── original
└── image/
    └── {xx}/
        └── {yy}/
            └── {hash}/
                └── original
```

- `{xx}/{yy}` is derived from the first four hex characters of the BLAKE3 hash (two-level sharding).
- `{hash}` is the full BLAKE3 content hash, used as the resource ID for content-addressed storage.
- Duplicate uploads are detected automatically — identical files produce the same hash and reuse existing storage.

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Go 1.26+
- Chi v5 router
- sqlc (type-safe database queries)
- SCS v2 session manager with SQLite store
- BLAKE3 hashing (t2bot/ahash)
- TOTP (pquerna/otp)
- bcrypt (share passwords)

**Database:**
- SQLite via modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go, CGO-free)
- WAL journal mode for concurrent reads

**Frontend:**
- Svelte 4 SPA
- Tailwind CSS 3
- Vite build tool
- hls.js (HLS playback)
- marked (Markdown rendering)
- QRCode.js (TOTP setup QR display)

**Transcoding:**
- ffmpeg with libx264 and AAC
- HLS adaptive quality ladder (360p, 720p, 1080p)
- Concurrent transcoding workers

**Build:**
- CGO_ENABLED=0 static binary
- vite-plugin-singlefile (SPA embedded into Go binary at compile time)

## Security Notes

1. **TOTP replaces passwords** — All user accounts authenticate via time-based one-time passwords. The TOTP secret is stored in the database and never logged.
2. **Bearer tokens** — API access uses tokens returned at login. These are independent of session cookies and can be used for automated clients.
3. **Session expiry** — Sessions use 30-minute sliding expiry via SCS v2.
4. **Rate limiting** — 60 requests/minute per IP applies globally to all routes.
5. **HTTPS** — Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) for TLS termination in production. Set `COOKIE_SECURE=true` when behind HTTPS.
6. **File type validation** — Uploaded files are identified by magic bytes, not file extensions. Incorrect extensions are corrected automatically.
7. **Protect DATA_DIR** — Media files and the database contain all application state. Ensure appropriate filesystem permissions.
8. **Roles enforced server-side** — Admin users have full access. Uploader users can only upload to assigned categories and delete their own resources.
